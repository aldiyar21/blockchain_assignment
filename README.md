# Blockchain Technologies Assignment: Implementing a Basic Blockchain with Merkle Tree
**Team members:** Dinmukhamed Kussayin, Aldiyar Muratkan                                                                   
**Group:** IT-2103                                                                       

# 1. Investigate Blockchain Principles

"Blockchain is a distributed decentralized peer-to-peer network to facilitate transactions between participants that are not only secure but also transparent, immutable, and traceable" (Ali et al., 2020).               

**Blockchain principles are:** Decentralization, Integrity, Security, Privace, Inclusive.                                                                
**Blockchain key working mechanisms:** Distributed Ledger, Cryptographic Hash Functions, Consensus Mechanisms (PoW, PoS), Transactions, Block creation and verification etc.

# 3.1 Define Blockchain Structure 
Blockchain consists of blocks. Every block in header has metadata: Previous Hash, Timestamp, Nonce, Merkle Root. Also it has transactions which include: ID, Sender Address, Receiver Address and Amount.                
Also Blockchain includes: chain, consensus mechanism, network, genesis block, cryptographic hashing and smart contracts (optional)

# 3.9 Final Review
The project was written in Python; the structure of the project consists of four classes: Block, Blockchain, Merkle node and Merkle tree. Each member contributed equally and was able to be helpful in creating the project                                          
**Libraries used:** time (allows to work with time in Python), hashlib (provides a suite of functions for hashing data).                                               
**Interface:** command line (4 actions).
